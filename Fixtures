FIXTURES -

STAND_ALONE_FUNCTION -> Python does not automatically about it.
                     -> If you define a fixture as it's parameter, you cannot call this function manually, only using pytest
                     for this reason you need to call this function in your test that has this fixture in it's paramters

                     -> If this function is decorated as a fixture, you do not need to call into test in order
                        of it's parameters(other fixtures) to work, as pytest handles this job.

If you pass a fixture to a standalone function, in order for this function to be able to
use the fixture, there are two options:

    1. Pass this function to a test
    2. Make it a fixture
